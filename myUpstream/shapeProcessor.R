# NOTES  ===============================================================================================

#   the "unionSpatialPolygons" function below is an important piece of this code
#   it is part of the "maptools" package
#   and maptools needs to use "gpclib"  -- not sure what this is -- someone could research
#   and, apparently "you can't give maptools the permission to use gpclib unless you have the package gpclib installed"
#   but, gpclib will not install without "Rtools", which needs to be "installed" from 
#       https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/
#   then
#   install.packages("gpclib")
#   will work, hoepfully!
# http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21093399/how-to-turn-gpclibpermit-to-true
#   and, there may be some importance to the order of the next three libarary statemenets (see )
# library(gpclib); library(rgeos); library(maptools)
# library(rgdal)   -- this might play an alterntive role in the issue above, but not sure
